                              SEO Science and you. You agree to pay the Fees monthly or annually in advance according to your Subscription Plan, or as
                               otherwise agreed between you and us, by credit card or another payment method accepted on the Website. If you decide to 
                               pay for the Service according to the invoice(s), you agree to pay all undisputed invoices within thirty (30) days,
                                unless otherwise mutually agreed between you and us in writing. You agree that we may charge interest of 1.5% per

                                  shall be borne solely by you. Unless otherwise stated, all payment obligations are non-cancellable and all Fees paid are
                                   non-refundable. If you demonstrate a pattern of repeated registrations for our paid Service followed by cancellation and
                                    request for refund, we may, in our sole discretion, 
                            withhold further registrations and/or refuse a further refund. </p>

                              refunds or credits for any VAT that was charged. If you are subject to GST, all Fees are exclusive of GST. If you are
                               required to deduct or withhold any tax, you must pay the amount deducted or withheld as required by law and pay us an additional amount so that we receive payment in 
                            full as if there were no deduction or withholding.  </p>

                            <p><strong>3.	Change in Fees. </strong><br>We reserve the right to monitor the number of Users using your User Account.

                                term of your Subscription Plan. If you are a Paid User, we may change the Fees and introduce new charges applicable to your 
                                use of the Service, which (unless otherwise agreed in writing with SEO Science) will become effective as of the first day of the renewal of your subscription term.

                               be electronic) if (a) SEO Science determines in good faith that your use of the Service violates any applicable law, the terms
                                of this Agreement or the rights of any third party; (b) we are prohibited by court order or order of another governmental
                                 authority from providing access to the Service; or (c) we reasonably determine that the Service is being used for any abusive,

                                   of business, a specific customer or customers, or a group of users. If you are a Paid User, We will use commercially
                                    reasonable efforts to give you thirty (30) days after notice of suspension to back up your data stored in the Service,
                                     after which we may remove it entirely from our servers. If you have any amounts due that remain unpaid for ten (10) days
                                      following your receipt of notice of non-payment, or if we are unable to process payment through your billing account 
                                       record, we may suspend your access to the Service, provided we will not suspend the portion of the Service for which
                                        you are disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the 
                                        dispute. If the Service, or portion thereof, are suspended for non-payment, we may charge a reactivation 
                             fee to reinstate the Service. Nothing in this section limits our right to terminate this Agreement for cause as outlined above.</p>
                             <p><strong>7.	Suspension and Termination of Unpaid Services. </strong><br> We may suspend, limit, or terminate Unpaid Services for any reason at any time without notice.
                              We may terminate your subscription to the Unpaid Services due to your inactivity.</p>
                             <p><strong>8.	Effect of Termination. </strong><br>Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, including by your cancellation,
                              or if you deregister your User account, all rights of the User with respect to the use of the Service shall terminate immediately.

                             <p><strong>9.	Survival. </strong><br>Upon any termination of this Agreement for any reason, all provisions regarding indemnification,
                              warranty, liability and limits thereon, and any provisions which expressly or by their nature are required to survive such

                             will be safeguarded by the Receiving Party to the same extent that the Receiving Party safeguards its own information of 
                             like kind, but using not less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party shall not use Confidential Information for
                              any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement or disclose Confidential Information to any third party (except as explicitly 
                              stated in our Privacy Policy).

If the Receiving Party is requested pursuant to a court or government order to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will give the Disclosing Party written notice (if not legally prohibited from doing so) sufficient to 
                            enable the Disclosing Party to seek protective order and the Receiving Party will cooperate with the Disclosing Party in such
                             effort. </p>
