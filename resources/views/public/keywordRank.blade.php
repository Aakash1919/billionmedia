                            <p>A keyword rank tracker is a tool by which you’re able to track specific keywords that you’re trying to rank for in search engines</p>
                            <p>The ability to track keywords is an important part of any SEO strategy.
                                  Knowing your positions in real time can give you the edge over your competitors. </p>
                            <p>If, for example, you’re trying to boost the position of a page, it’s important to be aware of the position you’re in before you update it. A poor update could see the rank fall. Similarly,
                                  it’s important to know that the changes you did make have had a positive impact on rankings. </p>
                             <p>This is what a keyword rank tracker helps you do.  </p>

                            <p>As we’ve touched upon already, having a Google ranking checker at your disposal allows you to implement your SEO strategy to greater effect. </p>
                            <p>Possessing the knowledge that your targeted keywords have firstly received a rank,
                                  the exact rank they’ve achieved and whether or not that keyword’s performance is improving or decreasing is vital.  </p>
                            <p>A keyword rank analyser will enable you to determine what approach you need to take—whether to update your pages or
                                  whether to leave them and allow them to grow. This is the biggest benefit of using a rank tracker—up to date knowledge.  </p>
