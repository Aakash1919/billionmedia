                            <h3>What We Collect</h3>
                            <p>We may collect data, including personal data, about you as you use our website and Service or request our Service and otherwise interact with us. Some of our website’s functionality can be used without providing
                                 any personal data, though for using some features, personal data is required. We process two broad categories of personal data:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Information provided directly by you;</li>
                            <li>	User information collected automatically.</li>              
</ul>
<h4>Information Provided Directly by You</h4>
<h5>Account registration</h5>
<p>If you register with our website at https://www.seoscience.com/, then as part of such registration we will ask you to provide certain personal data,
     including your name, your company name (if applicable), your email address and password. </p>
     <p>If you create an account or log into the Service using third-party services, such as Google or Facebook, we will receive your 
         name and email address as permitted by your profile settings on the third-party service in order to authenticate you. The
          information we receive when you authenticate through a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy 
          policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always 
         check the privacy settings and notices in the relevant third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us. </p>
         <h5>Communication with SEO Science</h5>
         <p>We collect data that you give us when you contact us with inquiries (including by filling out contact forms on our websites), 
             engage with our live chat service on the website, or contact our customer support regarding a problem you are experiencing.</p>
             <h5>Transactions</h5>
             <p>We collect details of transactions you carry out using the Service including information you provide to enable us to fulfill your order, which may include financial information such as your bank or credit card number. As a paying user of the Service,
                  we will receive your payment transaction details (for example, your name, the amount paid and the date of payment).</p>

             <h5>Payment Information</h5>
             <p>We collect payment and billing information when you register for our paid Service. For example, upon registration we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information. You may also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services. If you sign-up for a free account,
                  you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription.</p>
             <h5>Additional Payment Information</h5>
             <p>You may choose to provide additional information such as your VAT,
                  additional billing address or name of the entity that you represent.</p>

             <h5>Identity Verification</h5>
             <p>In some cases (for example if you request a refund) we may ask you to provide us information such as your billing information (name, transaction ID, last 4 digits of the bank or credit card associated with the account, billing date, etc.), email address,
                  login name, and if needed, information that verifies your identity, in accordance with applicable law.</p>

             <h5> Use of our blog, requesting content or creating a Public Profile</h5>
             <p>If you use our blog to post comments or would like to participate in our events, we may ask you to provide us with some information (such as your name, job title, your photo or other information). By posting any information on publicly accessible blogs or other areas of our website you acknowledge and agree that the data you provide on our websites - including information provided to create your public profile -
                  would be visible to any member of the public who accesses the website. You can change this information at any time.</p>

             <h5>Reviews And Testimonials</h5>
             <p>We collect and display reviews and testimonials of our customers in addition to other endorsements, such as those
                  from professional organisations. With your consent, we may post your testimonial, but we will check with you first. </p>

             <h5>Information Received From Third Parties</h5>
             <p>We may obtain personal data about you from our authorised resellers or distributors, for example, if you purchase access to the Services through one of these partners. The personal data we may receive include business contact information, 
                 including mailing addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers.</p>

             <h5>Information Collected Automatically</h5>
             <p>Like many other commercial websites, we use certain technologies, such as tools for collecting usage data, cookies, pixels,
                  and similar technologies, to automatically collect information that may contain personal data as you navigate our website.</p>

             <h5>Device and Usage Data</h5>
             <p>When users come to our website, we may track, collect, and aggregate information indicating which pages of our websites were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which links were clicked. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user. We may be able to 
                 determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of their point of connectivity.</p>

             <h5>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h5>
             <p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google Ireland Limited (Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland). The use includes the "Universal Analytics" operating mode. This facilitates the assignment of data, sessions and
                  interactions across several devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus the analysis of a user's activities across devices.
                  SEO Science uses YouTube API Services. If you are using our Service, by agreeing to our Privacy Policy you hereby also certify that you have read and agree to YouTube’s General Terms of Service (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and Google’s Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). In addition to normal procedure for deleting stored data, you can revoke 
                    access to your data via the Google security settings page at https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1.</p>
